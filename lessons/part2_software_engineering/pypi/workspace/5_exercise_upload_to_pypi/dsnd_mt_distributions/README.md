# Data Scientist Nanodegree Distributions
Gaussian and Binomial utility classes.

## Installations
This project was created using Python 3.
```
pip install dsnd-mt-probability
```
Scipy and Numpy are dependencies.

## Project Motivation
This package was uploaded as part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree from Udacity.
It is not really intended to be used. It is just to practice uploading packages to PyPI.

## How to interact with the project
```
from Gaussiandistribution import Gaussian

dist = Gaussian(mu=0, sigma=0.5)
dist.pdf(0.8)
```

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
