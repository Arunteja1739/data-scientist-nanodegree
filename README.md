# Data Scientist Nanodegree
This repository contains the solutions to exercises and projects for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. It also contains links and bibliography that was collected while studying for the program.

## Installations
The "data" conda env can be useful to run many of the notebooks and scripts.
```
conda env create -f data.yml
source activate data
python -m ipykernel install --user --name data --display-name "data"
```

## Project Motivation
I have the firm intention to work as a Data Scientist for, at least, the next 10 or 15 years. To that end, I am trying to gather all the knowledge I can find to help me. This program offers to me a lot of advice about how to standardize my way of working and showing the work done, many resources to keep learning, and a sense of the market and the realities of the day-to-day job of a Data Scientist.

## File Descriptions
The repository is divided in "lessons" and "projects". The lessons folder contains all the information that I considered relevant to save, while studying for the lessons. Some exercises are completed there, too. The projects folder contains some of the projects that were proposed during the courses. Some other projects were completed in individual repositories, so they are no here.

## Results and Conclusions
This is still a project in progress. No conclusions yet.
